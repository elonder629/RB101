Q2)
    A) '!' is a method that returns the opposite truth value of an object,
        however it can also be part of a method name usually indicating a method
        that mutates the caller, the '?' is the ternary operator of if.. else statements
        i.e true ? true : False

    1> the != is a conditional operator, used in logic statements
    2> Putting ! before something will return the objects opposite truth value
    3> putting a ! after something can sometimes change what method you are using
       because method names can contain '!' but if it isnt a real method name you
       will receive an error because there is no method of that names
    4> putting '?' before something will cause a sytax error because it is the
       ternary operator for if else
    5> putting '?' after something may change the method you are using other wise
       its simply a syntax error
    6>
       Putting '!!' before something will return the truth value of an object
